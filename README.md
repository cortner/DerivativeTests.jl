## TODO

* discuss and clean up the entire logic of this package
* robust heuristic for choosing fd parameter `h`
* options for other fd operations
* unified code for scalar / vectorial functions
* should the finite differences be performed in higher precision to get more robust tests?
* use logging instead of `@printf`???
* extend to admit `StaticArrays` (or at least test this!)
* create a "report type"
